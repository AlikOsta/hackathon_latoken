People will not vote for wars or injustice erasing the value of their trading accounts. If Latoken isn't able to democratize the capital markets, billions of people may remain blinded and disconnected from the opportunity, resulting in the growth of inequality, alienation, and ultimately jeopardizing shared prosperity. We are building Latoken to enlighten individuals, encouraging cooperation for long-term prosperity and making them active stakeholders in a better future. Our vision is for billions of people to trade millions of assets, pushing the boundaries of finance and technology. We will have to overcome the challenge of listing the best assets and making them easy to understand and trade, but we will succeed by scaling listing sales and partnerships and making it easy to understand the business, on-chain, and social data of the tokens.

Google’s position in the search market is so dominant that they determined that anything that makes the Internet faster accrues to their benefit as it enables users to do more searches. As the clear market leader, they focus more on expanding the market than dealing with their search competitors. In contrast, a classic wartime mission was Andy Grove’s drive to get out of the memory business in the mid 1980s due to an irrepressible threat from the Japanese semiconductor companies. In this mission, the competitive threat—which could have bankrupted the company—was so great that Intel had to exit its core business, which employed 80% of its staff.",
                "In my personal experience, I was a peacetime CEO for about 9 months, then a wartime CEO for the next 7 years. My greatest management discovery through that transition was that peacetime and wartime require radically different management styles. Interestingly, most management books describe peacetime CEO techniques while very few describe wartime. For example, a basic principle in most management books is that you should never embarrass an employee in a public setting. On the other hand, in a room filled with people, Andy Grove once said to an employee who entered the meeting late: “All I have in this world is time, and you are wasting my time.” Why such different approaches to management?",

As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives.

John Chambers had a great run as peacetime CEO of Cisco, but has struggled as Cisco has moved into war with Juniper, HP, and a range of new competitors.

Ringelmann discovered that as more and more people are added to a group, the group often becomes increasingly inefficient, ultimately violating the notion that group effort and team participation reliably leads to increased effort on behalf of the members.",

Most notably, Ingham, Levinger, Graves, and Peckham (1974) discovered that group members continue to exhibit reductions in rope-pulling force even after being placed in pseudo-groups (i.e., groups composed of confederates and one, true participant). In their study, Ingham et al. (1974) directed confederates to pretend to pull on a rope by faking exertion, suggesting to the real participant that all members were working together. What proves of interest here is that because there was virtually no coordination between the participant and the confederates (they were not physically taking part in the actions), poor communication cannot account for the decrease in effort.[11] Therefore, Ingham et al. (1974) support the assertion that motivational losses largely determine an individual’s decline in performance when acting as a member of a group.",

Thus hardwork is not a beneficial and desirable strategy (eg. it is not Nash stable as someone can pursue a different strategy with a larger benifit).",

                "We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do. While recognizing that the old way may still be the best way, we constantly strive to find a better solution to the client’s problems. We pride ourselves on pioneered many of the practices and techniques that will become standard in the industry. We make an unusual effort to identify and recruit the very best person for every job.  In a service business, we know that without the best people, we cannot be the best firm. We offer our people the opportunity to move ahead more rapidly than is possible at most other places. Advancement depends on merit and we have yet to find the limits to the responsibility our best people are able to assume. For us to be successful, our men and women must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be.",
                "We stress teamwork in everything we do. While individual creativity is always encouraged, we have found that team effort often produces the best results. We have no room for those who put their personal interests ahead of the interests of the firm and its clients. The dedication of our people to the firm and the intense effort they give to their jobs are greater than one finds in most other organizations. We think that this is an important part of our success. We consider our size an asset that we try hard to preserve. We want to be big enough to undertake the largest project that any of our clients could contemplate, yet small enough to maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the esprit de corps that we all treasure and that contribute greatly to our success. We constantly strive to anticipate the rapidly changing needs of our clients and to develop new services to meet those needs. We know that the world of finance will not stand still and that complacency can lead to extinction.",

                "Additional Procedures",
                "All of our employees are required to affirm that they have reviewed the Code and will comply with it.   Our clients’ interests always come first. If we serve our clients well, our own success will follow. Our assets are our people, capital and reputation. If any of these is ever diminished, the last is the most difficult to restore. Despite the infant industry development stage, regulation and common business practices, we are dedicated and we will do all we can to comply with the letter and spirit of the laws, rules and ethical principles that govern us. Significant employee stock ownership aligns the interests of our employees and our shareholders. We take great pride in the professional quality of our work. We have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake. Though we may be involved in a wide variety and heavy volume of activity, we would, if it came to a choice, rather be best than biggest."
